  "description": "The Santa Marta tapeti is a species of cottontail rabbit native to the lowlands of northern Colombia. It was previously considered a subspecies of the common tapeti but analysis in 2017 confirmed that it is sufficiently distinct in both appearance and genetics to be considered a species in its own right. The name Santa Marta tapeti is derived from the mountain range where the species was first discovered, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.",
