  "description": "The black mongoose is a subspecies of the Angolan slender mongoose occurring in Namibia and Angola. Although originally described as a separate species by Oldfield Thomas in 1928, it has often been considered a subspecies of the slender mongoose. However, genetic analysis indicated that it was distinct, and it was later classified as a distinct species. However, more evidence indicates that it is in fact conspecific with the Angolan slender mongoose.",
