  "description": "The white-nosed saki is a species of bearded saki, a type of New World monkey, endemic to the south-central Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Both its scientific and common name were caused by the authors working from dead specimens, where the skin on and around the nose fades to a whitish color. In living individuals, the nose is actually bright pink. Pelage on the body tends to be black in males and brown to brownish-grey in females. No other species of the genus Chiropotes have a brightly coloured nose.",
