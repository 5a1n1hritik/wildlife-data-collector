  "description": "The D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago pogonomys, also known as the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago tree mouse, is a species of prehensile-tailed rat from the family Muridae that is endemic to Papua New Guinea. It was once considered to be a subspecies of the Large Tree Mouse. Deforestation is posing a threat to the species, but it has been suspected that the species has some degree of tolerance towards disturbance of its habitat.",
