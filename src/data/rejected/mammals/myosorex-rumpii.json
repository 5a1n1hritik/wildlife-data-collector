  "description": "The Rumpi mouse shrew is a Myosoricinae shrew only known from the Rumpi Hills, Cameroon. The only known specimen is the holotype, collected around 1967. First described by Heim de Balsac in 1968, it was considered a subspecies of Myosorex eisentrauti. A reanalysis by Hutterer in 2005 elevated it to a full species.",
