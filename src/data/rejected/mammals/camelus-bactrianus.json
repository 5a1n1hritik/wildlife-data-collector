  "description": "The Bactrian camel, also known as the Mongolian camel, domestic Bactrian camel, two-humped camel or double humped camel, is a camel native to the steppes of Central Asia. It has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped dromedary. Its population of 2 million exists mainly in the domesticated form. Their name comes from the ancient historical region of Bactria.",
