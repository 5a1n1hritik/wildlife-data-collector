  "description": "The marsh rabbit is a small cottontail rabbit found in marshes and swamps of coastal regions of the Eastern and Southern United States, from Virginia to the lower Florida Keys. Being a small brown rabbit, it is similar in appearance to the widespread eastern cottontail, but is characterized by its smaller ears, legs, and tail, as well as its grayish-brown underparts.",
