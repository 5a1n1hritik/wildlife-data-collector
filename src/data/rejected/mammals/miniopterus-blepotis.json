  "description": "The Javanese long-fingered bat is a species of bat from the Miniopterus genus native to Indonesia. A common misconception was that Miniopterus blepotis belonged to the M. schreibersii subspecies. M. blepotis was recognized as a distinct species after the Schreibersii complex was divided. This is backed up by New Guinean mtDNA sequence data that is ascribed to M. blepotis. Whether it is a complex made up of multiple species is unknown.",
