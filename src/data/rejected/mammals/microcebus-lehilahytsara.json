  "description": "Goodman's mouse lemur is a species of mouse lemur from the region near Andasibe in eastern Madagascar. The species is named in honor of primatologist Steven M. Goodman. \"Lehilahytsara\" is a combination of the Malagasy words which mean \"good\" and \"man\". The finding was presented August 10, 2005, along with the discovery of the northern giant mouse lemur as a separate species.",
