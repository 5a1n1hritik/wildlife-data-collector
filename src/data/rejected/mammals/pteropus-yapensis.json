  "description": "The Pelew flying fox is a species of megabat from the genus Pteropus found in the Palau Islands. A subspecies found on Yap, the Yap flying fox, is considered as a separate species by some authorities. The species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN due to commercial and small-scale hunting. Commercial hunting for the species was banned in 1994, but local exploitation is common. The species is listed on CITES appendix I.",
