  "description": "The Mexican prairie dog is a diurnal burrowing rodent native to north-central Mexico. It is classified as a keystone species due to its large impact on other species and the environment. Treatment as an agricultural pest has led to its status as an endangered species. They are closely related to squirrels, chipmunks, and marmots. Cynomys mexicanus originated about 230,000 years ago from a peripherally isolated population of the more widespread Cynomys ludovicianus.",
