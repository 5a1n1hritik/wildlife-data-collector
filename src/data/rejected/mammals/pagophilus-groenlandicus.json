  "description": "The harp seal, also known as the saddleback seal or Greenland seal, is a species of earless seal, or true seal, native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean. Originally in the genus Phoca with a number of other species, it was reclassified into the monotypic genus Pagophilus in 1844. In Greek, its scientific name translates to \"Greenlandic ice-lover\", and its taxonomic synonym, Phoca groenlandica translates to \"Greenlandic seal\". This is the only species in the genus Pagophilus.",
