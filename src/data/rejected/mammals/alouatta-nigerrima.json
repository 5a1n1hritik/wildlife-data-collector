  "description": "The Amazon black howler is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, endemic to the south-central Amazon in Brazil. Until 2001, most authorities included it as a subspecies of the red-handed howler, though its distinction had already been pointed out much earlier. As suggested by its name, it typically appears entirely black.",
