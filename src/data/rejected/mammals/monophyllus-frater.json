  "description": "The Puerto Rican long-nosed bat is known only from a skull fragment excavated in the large Cathedral Cave near Morovis, Puerto Rico, by Dr. H. E. Anthony prior to 1917. This species was never observed or documented live. Its extinction is attributed to hurricanes. A fossil fragment was cataloged in London.",
