  "description": "Nigiri vandeleuria, also known as the Nigiri long-tailed tree mouse and the Indian long-tailed tree mouse, is a species of rodent in the family Muridae. There has been some dispute as to whether this specimen is actually a subspecies of the Asiatic long-tailed climbing mouse but current opinion seems to suggest that it is indeed a separate species. It is found in India.",
