  "description": "The star-nosed mole is a small semiaquatic mole found in moist, low elevation areas in the northeastern parts of North America. It is the only extant member of the tribe Condylurini and genus Condylura. It has more than 25,000 minute sensory receptors in touch organs, known as Eimer's organs, with which this hamster-sized mole feels its way around. With the help of its Eimer's organs, it may be perfectly poised to detect seismic wave vibrations.",
