  "description": "The orange-headed Pilbara planigale, formerly known as Planigale 1, is a species of planigale first described in 2023, and is one of the smallest of all mammals. The orange-headed Pilbara planigale lives in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where it co-occurs with the similar and also newly recognised cracking-clay Pilbara planigale. Both species had historically been mistaken for either the common planigale, or long-tailed planigale, neither of which are now known to occur in the Pilbara.",
