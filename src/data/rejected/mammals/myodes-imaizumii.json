  "description": " Imaizumi's red-backed vole is a species of vole in the family Cricetidae. It is found in Japan and was initially designated as a subspecies of the Japanese red-backed vole, with studies of cranial and molar patterns supporting this. However, genetic tests in the late 1990s provide support for the theory that C. imaizumii is indeed a separate species, and it is now considered such pending the completion of more detailed studies.",
