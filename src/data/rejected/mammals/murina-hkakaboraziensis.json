  "description": "The Hkakabo Razi tube-nosed bat, also known colloquially as the Lance Bass bat is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. It is found only in Myanmar. The bat earned its nickname due to its spiky blonde pelage, which reminded people of Lance Bass, a member of the boy band NSYNC.",
