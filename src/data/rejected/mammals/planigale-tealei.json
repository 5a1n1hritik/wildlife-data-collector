  "description": "The cracking-clay Pilbara planigale, formerly known as Planigale sp. Mt Tom Price, is a species of planigale first described in 2023. It is one of the smallest planigales, making it one of the smallest of all marsupials and mammals. The cracking-clay Pilbara planigale lives in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where it co-occurs with the similar and also newly recognised orange-headed Pilbara planigale. Both species had historically been mistaken for either the common planigale, or long-tailed planigale ; neither of which are now known to occur in the Pilbara.",
