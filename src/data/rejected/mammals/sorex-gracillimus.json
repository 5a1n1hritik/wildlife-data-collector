  "description": "The slender shrew is a species of shrew. An adult slender shrew has a weight of 1.5–5.3 g (0.053–0.187 oz) and a body length of 4.7–6.0 cm (1.9–2.4 in), with a tail of 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in); this makes it one of the smaller shrews found in its range. It is distributed across northeastern North Korea, Hokkaidō, and the Russian Far East including the Kuril Islands.",
