  "description": "The Indian palm squirrel or three-striped palm squirrel is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae found naturally in India and Sri Lanka. In the late 19th century, the palm squirrel was introduced to Madagascar, Réunion, Mayotte, Comoro Islands, Mauritius, and Seychelles. The closely related five-striped palm squirrel is found in northern India, and its range partly overlaps with this species.",
