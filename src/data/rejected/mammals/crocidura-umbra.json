It is endemic to Java where it is known only from Mount Gede and can be found from the type locality at 1,611 and 1,950 m elevation on Mt. Gede. Its natural habitat is tropical montane rainforest. It has a restricted range and is threatened by habitat loss. It was first described as a new species to science in 2016 and the authors recommended the name 'Javan ghost shrew' as its English common name.\"Relative to other Javan shrews, the new species is small with a relatively thick, dark brown, medium-length tail\".",
