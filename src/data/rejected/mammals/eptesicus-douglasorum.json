  "description": "The yellow-lipped cave bat is a vesper bat, an insectivorous flying mammal, that only occurs in the Kimberley region of north-west Australia. The bat was first captured at Tunnel Creek in 1958 and a description published nearly twenty years later. Aside from observations of their physical characteristics, a preference for caves, and hunting insects over streams, little is known of the species.",
