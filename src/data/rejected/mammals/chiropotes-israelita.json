  "description": "The brown-backed bearded saki is one of five species of bearded saki, a type of New World monkey. It is endemic to the Amazon in north-western Brazil and southern Venezuela. It is possible the correct scientific name for this species is C. chiropotes, in which case the more easterly red-backed bearded saki would be named C. sagulatus. The IUCN lists the reddish-brown bearded saki as a valid species, with C. israelita as a synonym, but also notes they might both be valid.",
