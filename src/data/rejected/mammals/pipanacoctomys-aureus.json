  "description": "The golden viscacha rat or golden vizcacha rat is the single species of the genus Pipanacoctomys of the rodent family Octodontidae. It has 92 chromosomes and has been regarded as tetraploid. This octodontid and its sister-species, the plains viscacha rat, may have arisen from the diploid mountain viscacha rat, as a result of the doubling and subsequent loss of some chromosomes. However, some genetic studies have rejected any polyploidism in mammals as unlikely, and suggest that amplification and dispersion of repetitive sequences best explain the large genome size.",
