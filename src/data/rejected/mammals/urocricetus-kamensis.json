  "description": "The Kam dwarf hamster is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is found only in the mountains of western China where it inhabits grassland, shrubby marshes and steppes. Although it has a limited range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\". It was recently moved from the genus Cricetulus to Urocricetus.",
