  "description": "The Seram long-tailed mosaic-tailed rat, also known as the Seram long-tailed melomys, is a species of rodent in the family Muridae.\nIt is found only on the south coast of the island of Seram in Indonesia. At one time it was thought to be a subspecies of the white-bellied mosaic-tailed rat but was subsequently raised to full species level. It differs from that species in having a much longer, scale-free tail with a calloused tip which is likely to be prehensile and used while climbing trees.",
