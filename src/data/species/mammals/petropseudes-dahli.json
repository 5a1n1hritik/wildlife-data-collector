It is found in rocky escarpments in the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and Gulf of Carpentaria across Western Australia and Northern Territory and just passing the Queensland border. It is also found on Groote Eylandt. According to some authorities, it is the only species in the genus Petropseudes, but other authorities place it among the members of the genus Pseudochirops.",
