  "description": "The Christmas Island shrew, also known as the Christmas Island musk-shrew, is an extinct species of shrew from Christmas Island. It was variously placed as subspecies of the Asian gray shrew or the Southeast Asian shrew, but morphological differences and the large distance between the species indicate that Christmas Island shrew is an entirely distinct species.",
