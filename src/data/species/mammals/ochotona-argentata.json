  "description": "The Helan Shan pika or silver pika is a rock-dwelling species of pika that is endemic to a small region of the Helan Mountains in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, China. As a pika, it is a small mammal that resembles and is closely related to rodents. It is a large species relative to other pikas, and has an orange-red fur coat that changes to silver in winter. This pika typically lives in forested areas among rocks and in tunnels and rock slides formed by human mining activities.",
