  "description": "Peters's myotis or the small black myotis is a species of insectivorous vesper bat. It is found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines; its exact distribution is uncertain as it is difficult to distinguish from some other Myotis species. It appears adaptable to a variety of habitats, including primary tropical moist lowland forest, secondary forest, agricultural areas and villages.",
