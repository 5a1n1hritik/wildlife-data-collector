  "description": "The dromedary, also known as the dromedary camel, Arabian camel and one-humped camel, is a large camel of the genus Camelus with one hump on its back. It is the tallest of the three camel species; adult males stand 1.8–2.4 m at the shoulder, while females are 1.7–1.9 m tall. Males typically weigh between 400 and 690 kg, and females weigh between 300 and 540 kg .\nThe dromedary's distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump, and long hairs on the throat, shoulders, and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, 20 cm (7.9 in) tall or more, is made of fat bound together by fibrous tissue.",
