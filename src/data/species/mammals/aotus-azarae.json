  "description": "Azara's night monkey, also known as the Azara's owl monkey, the southern night monkey, or the mirikiná, is a night monkey species from South America. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Paraguay. The species is monogamous, with males providing a large amount of parental care. It is named after Spanish naturalist Félix de Azara. Although primarily nocturnal, some populations of Azara's night monkey are unique among night monkeys in being cathemeral: active at both day and night. The species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.",
