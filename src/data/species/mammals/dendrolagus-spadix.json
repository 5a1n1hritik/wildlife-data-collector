  "description": "The lowlands tree-kangaroo, also spelt \"lowland,\" is a long-tailed, furry, bear-like mammal found only in lowland tropical rainforests on the island of New Guinea. It is a species of tree-kangaroo, which are tree-dwelling animals that feed on leaves or other plant matter. Tree-kangaroos are in the macropod family (Macropodidae) with kangaroos, and like other marsupials they carry their young in a pouch. The lowlands tree-kangaroo is threatened by habitat loss.",
