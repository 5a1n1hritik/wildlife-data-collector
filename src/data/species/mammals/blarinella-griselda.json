  "description": "The Indochinese short-tailed shrew is a species of mammal of the family Soricidae found in China and Vietnam. The species is a semifossorial red-toothed shrew with a stout body and short, slender tail. Although this species was originally classified under Blarinella, recent Cytochrome b analysis suggests this species should be classified under a new genus, placing it in Parablarinella alongside one other species.",
