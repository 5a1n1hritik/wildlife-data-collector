  "description": "The Asian palm civet, also called common palm civet, toddy cat and musang is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. Since 2008, it is IUCN Red Listed as least concern as it accommodates to a broad range of habitats. It is widely distributed with large populations that in 2008 were thought unlikely to be declining. It is threatened by poaching for the illegal wildlife trade.",
