  "description": "The Jatna’s tarsier, also known locally as Mimito, is a species of tarsier endemic to the northern Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Indonesia. Previously classified together with the Spectral tarsier, this species was reclassified and elevated as a separate species in 2017 due to their distinct and separate acoustic duet calls between males and females.",
