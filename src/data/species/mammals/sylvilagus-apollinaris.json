  "description": "The Bogota tapeti is a species of cottontail rabbit related to the common tapeti. It is endemic to a region south of the Isthmus of Panama, generally described as \"northern Colombia\". Previously a subspecies of either the common tapeti or Andean tapeti, it was split and considered a separate species in 2017. Later morphological evidence was examined that supported its separation from S. brasilensis.",
