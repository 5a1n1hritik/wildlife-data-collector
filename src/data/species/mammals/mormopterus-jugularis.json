  "description": "Peters's wrinkle-lipped bat, also called Peters's goblin bat, is a species of bat in the family Molossidae, the free-tailed bats. It is endemic to Madagascar, where it is widespread and in some areas abundant. It commonly roosts in human-made structures, sometimes in colonies with other free-tailed bat species. It forages in the open, often in agricultural areas.\nThe bat is sexually dimorphic, with males larger than females.",
