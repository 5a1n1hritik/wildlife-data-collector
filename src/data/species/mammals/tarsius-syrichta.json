  "description": "The Philippine tarsier is a species of tarsier endemic to the Philippines. It is found in the southeastern part of the archipelago, particularly on the islands of Bohol, Samar and Leyte. It is a member of the approximately 45-million-year-old family Tarsiidae, whose name is derived from its elongated \"tarsus\" or ankle bone. Formerly a member of the genus Tarsius, it has since been listed as the only member of the genus Carlito, a new genus named after the conservationist Carlito Pizarras.",
