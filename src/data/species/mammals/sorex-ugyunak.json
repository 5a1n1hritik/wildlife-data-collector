  "description": "The barren ground shrew is a small shrew found in northern Canada west of Hudson Bay and in Alaska. At one time, this species was considered to be a subspecies of the similar cinereus shrew. It is similar in appearance and thought to be closely related to the Saint Lawrence Island shrew and Pribilof Island shrew.",
