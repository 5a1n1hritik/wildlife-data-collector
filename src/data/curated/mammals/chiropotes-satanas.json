  "description": "The black bearded saki is a species of New World monkey, native to the Amazon rainforest of South America, specifically to an area of north-eastern Brazil. It is one of five species of bearded saki. Bearded sakis are medium-sized (50 cm), mostly frugivorous primates, specialised in seed predation. The genus name Chiropotes comes from Ancient Greek χείρ (kheír), meaning \"hand\", and ποτης (potēs), meaning \"drinker\", as the black bearded saki is sometimes observed immersing their hands in water and then bringing them to their mouth to drink. This behaviour was later found to be widespread among monkey species and not a distinguishing feature of this genus or species. The black bearded saki's habitat has undergone heavy habitat fragmentation, making the future conservation status of the species uncertain.",
