This omnivorous member of the Callitrichidae family is usually found in groups of 4 and shares social relations with other callitrichids. They communicate vocally, as well as with olfactory signals. Males tend to be primary caregivers for their young. It is considered as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, despite threats from increased habitat loss.",
