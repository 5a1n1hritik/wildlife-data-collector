  "description": "The gray flying fox is a species of flying fox in the family Pteropodidae. It is not to be confused with the Grey-headed flying fox. It is found in Indonesia and Timor-Leste, but not in the Philippines, despite occasional reference to such. Very little is known about this species. The gray flying fox has small size and neutral coloration with a brownish head and an orange abdomen. It probably roosts individually or in small groups. It was listed on appendix II of CITES, and is classified as \"Data Deficient\" by the IUCN. This species has been decimated by hunting for bushmeat in Indonesia.\nThe hunters use fishing hooks, ropes, and other supplies to hunt the bats. The ropes and hooks are placed along their flight paths, tearing and ensnaring the bats' wings when are flying. In the course of a hunting season, entire colonies can be killed.",
