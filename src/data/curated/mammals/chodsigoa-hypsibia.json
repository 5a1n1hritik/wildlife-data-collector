  "description": "The De Winton's shrew is a species of mammal in the family Soricidae. It is endemic to central China, where it occurs primarily in the Hengduan Shan mountains at altitudes between 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) and 3,500 metres (11,500 ft). There are several other populations in East Xizang, the Qinling Shan mountains, and the Eastern Tombs in Hebei. The latter one is found a lower altitude than the others, at around 300 metres (980 ft).",
