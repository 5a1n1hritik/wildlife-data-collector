  "description": "Enders's small-eared shrew is a species of mammal in the family Soricidae. It is endemic to Panama. This species is larger than the other species in the Cryptotis genus and has a tail that is about 49-60% of their head and body length. There have only been two specimens found in 1950 and 1980 which interests scientists but also concerns them about conservation.",
