  "description": "The Nubra pika is a species of pika found in Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is a small diurnal mammal with a fur coat that changes color across seasons and regions, ranging from gray to brownish red. It has blackish ears with a distinctive pale patch on the back, a very small tail, and a flat, narrow skull. It is closely related to the plateau pika and Sikkim pika, and is widely distributed across the Himalayas. It is among the burrowing species of pika, and eats a variety of plants. This pika's range overlaps with that of the Sikkim pika, one subspecies of Moupin pika, and the large-eared pika. One subspecies of the Nubra pika is restricted to part of the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region.",
