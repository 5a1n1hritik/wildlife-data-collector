  "description": "Eumops wilsoni is a species of bat native to Ecuador and Peru. The bat has a distinct karyotype, sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene, and other distinct genetic markers that distinguish it from closely related bats such as Eumops glaucinus and Eumops ferox. However, there are no morphological distinctions from those related species and thus there is uncertainty about its geographic distribution and population status, leading to its classification as \"data deficient\". Local threats to the bat's dry forest habitat further impede efforts to study the bats. Transition to farmland and urbanization threatens the dry forest habitat of the bat in the Andes. As an endemic species, the bat may be threatened by this habitat loss.",
