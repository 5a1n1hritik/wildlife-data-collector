  "description": "The clear-winged woolly bat is a species of vesper bat in the family Vespertilionidae. \nIt is found in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Members of this species are relatively small, typically weighing about 4.5 g (0.16 oz) and mainly forages in the understory of tropical forests. This species also presents a unique variant of echolocation that is a higher intensity and lower frequency than most other kerivoula calls. The short range calls are distinguishable from the long range orientational echolocation calls by peak frequency and duration.",
