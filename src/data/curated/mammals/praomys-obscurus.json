  "description": "The Gotel Mountain soft-furred mouse or Gotel Mountain praomys, is a species of rodent in the family Muridae. It is endemic to the Gotel Mountains in southeastern Nigeria. It occurs in fern-grassland, montane forest, along streams in forest, gallery forest, and swamp forest, at elevations of 1,600–2,400 m (5,200–7,900 ft) above sea level. It is threatened by habitat loss (deforestation), presumably caused by logging and the conversion of land to agricultural and other uses.",
