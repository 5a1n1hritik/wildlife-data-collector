  "description": "The Sumatran water shrew is a red-toothed shrew found only in the Padang highlands of western Sumatra, Indonesia. Its natural habitats are streams in montane forests. The species is only known from a holotype, which is damaged, and was previously listed as critically endangered by IUCN. It is believed to be severely threatened by habitat loss.",
