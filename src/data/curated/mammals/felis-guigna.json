  "description": "The kodkod, also called güiña, is the smallest felid species native to the Americas. It lives primarily in central and southern Chile, as well as marginally in adjoining areas of Argentina. Between 1996 and 2002, it was listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List as the total population was thought to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals; it is threatened by persecution, habitat loss and prey base.",
