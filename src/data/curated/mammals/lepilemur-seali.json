  "description": "Seal's sportive lemur, or the Anjanaharibe-Sud sportive lemur, is a sportive lemur endemic to Madagascar. Previous to a 2006 genetic analysis showing the species to be distinct, it was thought to be a population of weasel sportive lemur. Like all members of its genus, it is nocturnal and largely folivorous. It is threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and climate change.",
