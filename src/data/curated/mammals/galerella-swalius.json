  "description": "The Namaqua slender mongoose, also known as the Namibian slender mongoose, is a subspecies of the common slender mongoose that is endemic to Namibia. It was originally considered separate from the common slender mongoose and thought to be a distinct species. However, further analysis found that the characteristics were not distinguishable as a separate species, and it was classified as a sub-species of the common slender mongoose.",
