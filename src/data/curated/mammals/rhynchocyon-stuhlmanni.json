  "description": "The Stuhlmann's sengi or white-tailed sengi is a species of elephant shrew that lives in the forests and savannas of Africa. It was discovered in 1893 and declared a new species. In the 1960s, however, it was downgraded to a subspecies of checkered sengi. In 2018, following genetic tests, scientists re-evaluated the mammal as a full species again.",
